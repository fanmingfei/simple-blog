### Web

We have seen how computers connected on the Internet communicate in different languages called **protocols**, to exchange emails, files, chat messages...

One of these protocols is called **HTTP**. It's the protocol with which computers share **Webpages** between each other, like the one you're currently reading.

The **Web** is the part of the Internet where Webpages are shared. You can tell you're browsing the Web if the URL starts with `http://`.
